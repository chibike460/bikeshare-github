### Date created
28th November, 2019.

### Project Title
Bikeshare Github Project

### Description
"Bikeshare Github Project" will create an interactive terminal on any Terminal IDE,
that receives input. Based on the provided input(s), the terminal may prompt the
user with more questions for input. Thereafter, statistics based on the user-
defined input(s)/criteria will be displayed.

The user will be prompted with a question, "would you want to see the raw
data?" If yes, raw data (columns cum rows) will be displayed until user specifies
otherwise. Lastly, the user will have a choice, to exit the program or restart!

The best part of this project is the fact that it is hosted on github. While on
this project, Git made changes, (little or much) seem so seamless and convenient.
Git is one of the world's most popular version control tool, and I must confess,
it was fun working with her.

### List of what software, firmware and hardware you may require.
bikeshares.py runs seamlessly on python version 3.0 and above.
You'd require Atom, Anaconda3 2019 and Git-2.24.0.2.
I worked on this project from a windows 10 OS, and I'd recommend it if you're a
windows user. Aside that, the latest MacOS should do just fine.

### Installation instructions for the software and firmware
ATOM
Copy AtomSetup file to the desktop of your computer.
Turn off Windows defender or any form of antivirus on your computer before
installing Atom.
Run AtomSetup as Administrator from desktop

ANACONDA3
Make sure there are no spaces in the path of your anaconda installation.

GIT
Make sure there are no spaces in the path of your git installation.
