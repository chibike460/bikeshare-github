### Date created
28th November, 2019.

### Project Title
Bikeshare Github Project

### Description
Bikeshare Github Project will create an interactive terminal on any Terminal IDE,
that receives input. Based on the provided input(s), the terminal may prompt the
user with more questions for input. Thereafter, statistics based on the user-
defined input(s)/criteria will be displayed.

The user will be prompted with a question, "would you want to see the raw
data?" If yes, raw data (columns cum rows) will be displayed until user specifies
otherwise. Lastly, the user will have a choice, to exit the program or restart!

The best part of this project is the fact that it is hosted on github. While on
this project, Git made changes, (little or much) seem so seamless and convenient.
Git is one of the world's most popular version control tool, and I must confess,
it was fun working with her.
